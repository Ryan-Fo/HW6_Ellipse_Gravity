# HW6_Ellipse_Gravity
Ryan's submission for HW6

ellipse_area.py is a download and run type py file. It will print out the calculated values of the code.

flatEarth_grav and global_grav files are also just a download and run kind of deal. They both process through roughly the same number of sections and take around the same time to run.
